Math::MatrixSparse 

VERSION 

0.01  INITIAL RELEASE

SYNOPSIS

Math::MatrixSparse is a module implementing naive sparse matrices.  Its
syntax is designed to partially overlap with Math::MatrixReal where
possible and reasonable.

Basic matrix operations are present, including addition, subtraction,
scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, transposition,
and exponentiation.

Three methods of solving systems iteratively are available, including
Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and Symmetric Over-Relaxation. 

Real-valued matrices can be read from files in the Matrix Market and
Harwell Boeing formats, and written in the Matrix Market format. In
addition, they can be read from a given string.

Certain special types of matrices are understood, but not optimized
for, such as upper and lower triangular, diagonal, symmetric,
skew-symmetric, positive, negative, and pattern.  Methods are
available to determine the properties of a given matrix.

Individual rows, columns, and diagonals of matrices can be obtained,
as can the upper and lower triangular, symmetric, skew symmetric,
positive and negative portions.
